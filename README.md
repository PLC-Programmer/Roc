# How to make a simple for-loop in Roc?

or maybe similarly in other (purely) functional programming languages.

Like this for example: https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Roc/blob/main/simple_counting.roc

Effect in Ubuntu 24 LTS:

_$ roc simple_counting.roc_

_0,11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99,110,121,132,143,154_

_Bye._

_$_

<br/>

I just added the factor 11 to index i to better see the effect. So, the default or neutral factor would be just 1 to loop from 0 to 14 inclusively.

There are two tricks involved:

#### Trick #1

(TBD)

#### Trick #2

(TBD)
